# Twitter x Tailwind CSS

This is a rebuild of the twitter web app using only Tailwind CSS.  It uses the Tailwind CSS 3.x CDN and a small custom config (to add the Twitter blue color).

Icon SVG's have been grabbed from Twitter. This is in no way affiliated with Twitter or Tailwind and is purely an example of what's possible using just Tailwind CSS.
